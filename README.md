# Automated PCB Visual Inspection & Annotation System Using MATLAB for Quality Control on Assembly Lines


## Problem Statement

In high-speed Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly production:

    * Manual inspection of defects is slow, inconsistent, and costly
    * Defects like missing components, solder errors, misalignments go unnoticed
    * Quality control needs automation with real-time detection

👉 Goal: Build a system to automatically detect and annotate PCB defects using computer vision.

## What is Automated Visual Inspection?

Automated optical inspection (AOI) scans PCBs with cameras and vision software to detect defects such as:

    * Missing components
    * Misplaced parts
    * Broken traces
    * Solder bridges

It’s widely used in SMT and PCB manufacturing because it can catch microscopic defects that humans can miss.

## Project Objective

Develop a system that:

    * Captures PCB images from an assembly line camera
    * Preprocesses images to enhance features
    * Detects defects using image processing and/or deep learning
    * Automatically annotates defects in each image
    * Outputs annotated images and defect counts
